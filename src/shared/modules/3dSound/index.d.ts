	 * @param id The unique ID of the sound. This is the ID from Roblox's sound library.
	 * @param target The target position or object to which the sound will be attached. Can be:
	 * - `CFrame`: The position and orientation of the attachment in 3D space.
	 * - `Vector3`: A specific point in 3D space.
	 * - `Instance`: A target object, where the sound will be attached.
	 * @param looped A boolean indicating if the sound should loop. Default is false.
	 * If false, the attachment will be automatically destroyed once the sound finishes playing.
	 * @returns An object containing the `Sound` instance and the `Attachment`.
	 * - `Sound`: The sound instance that has been created.
	 * - `Attachment`: The created attachment object.
